In the folder `lab-materials/03`, you will find a Notebook file: `03-stars-classification.ipynb` and a CSV file.  
This is all that was saved after the VM was *accidentally* deleted.

Your task is to ensure the ASA can easily process the data extracted by the CAIx telescope. Follow these steps:

. From OpenShift AI, create a new workbench.  
. Resolve any issues in the notebook.  
. Schedule a pipeline to run the notebook and process the data every 24 hours.

The ASA trusts you! You are our last hope!
