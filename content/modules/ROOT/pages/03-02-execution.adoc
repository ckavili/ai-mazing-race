In the folder `lab-materials/03`, you will find a Notebook file: `03-stars-classification.ipynb` and a CSV file.

This is all that was saved from the sangria-soaked laptop.

Your task is to ensure the ASSA can easily process the data extracted by the CAIx telescope. Follow these steps:

. From OpenShift AI, create a new workbench
. Resolve any issues in the notebook code
. Schedule a pipeline to run that notebook daily

The ASSA trusts you! You are our last hope!
