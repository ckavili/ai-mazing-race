== Teaser

Are you ready to run the **Predictive AI** gauntlet? In this fast-paced adventure, you will tackle high-stakes scenarios inspired by diverse industries, use-cases, and countries. You will need to draw on your AI knowledge, grit, creativity, and soft skills to assist these nations in need.

You and your ragtag band of IT professionals will have to think on your feet to provide solutions powered by **Red Hat AI products** to multiple countries. The pressure is on! Can you rise to the challenge? Can you save the day? And more importantly... can you do it within budget?

== Fair warning

You may not have all the answers, but we sure have a lot of questions!

This lab is meant to be a challenging exercise, for which you may or may not already have all the required knowledge!

We don't actually care. We are more interested in seeing how you learn by doing! Or even better, by pairing up with a stranger who may just happen to have the information you lack.

Although we provide hints and even some solutions, we really hope you can come up with things that are BETTER than what we had in mind.

If you're up for this AI-mazing chance to hack away, go to the next page so we can set the stage!
