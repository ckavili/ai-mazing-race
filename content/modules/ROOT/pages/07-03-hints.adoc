====
Try removing some features that SHAP says is dragging down the price, but be careful with removing the categories as they also seem to help the prediction in some cases.  
When you change the features, the datapoints that predict below zero might also change, so make sure to change the `DATAPOINT` that's used for CounterFactual and SHAP.

====
Remove the `discounted` and `discount_amount` features to get only possitive values.
