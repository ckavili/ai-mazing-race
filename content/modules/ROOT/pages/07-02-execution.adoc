Start by going to your Data Science project and create a new workbench with these settings:
- Image: TrustyAI
- Size: Small
Feel free to pick any name for the workbench.

After that's done, clone this repository into the workbench: [https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/ai-mazing-race](https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/ai-mazing-race)

Go to the folder `lab-materials/07` where you will the model and code to help you analyze and build new ones.  

== Task 1 - Understand what's wrong  
Run through the code in notebook `1_model_training_and_analyzis` to build a model and see what might be wrong with it.  
How does it perform on the evaluation, are there any features that seem to be suspiciously impactful?  

== Task 2 - Propose and test changes  
After you have made some thoughts on what might be wrong, go back to the start of the notebook and change what features are used and how the data is processed.  
The goal is to get as small of an error as possible while also having no negative prices (they are typically bad for business).
