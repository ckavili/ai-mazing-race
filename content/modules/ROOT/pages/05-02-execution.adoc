In the folder `lab-materials/05`, you'll find a Notebook file: `1-experiment_train_baklava.ipynb`, along with data covering the past ten years of baklava consumption across regions in Türkiye.

The notebook contains the model code with parameters ready for you to tweak and experiment with. Note: every time you run the cells, the results of the previous experiment will be overwritten. To avoid losing your work, be sure to save your experiments before starting a new one!

You have the flexibility to store information about your experiments and model in the Model Registry using either the UI or the SDK—it's entirely up to you.

The notebook includes helpful explanations, so take the time to read them carefully.

Once you've identified the best settings for your model within five experiments, deploy the best-performing one! 

Good luck, and happy experimenting!
