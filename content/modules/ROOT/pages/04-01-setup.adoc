* The situation is critical...
* The French government has received a picture from one of its spies, as well as a tiny piece of code.
* They are sure the picture contains a hidden message.
* However, there is a strike at the Ministry of Defense. So no one had access to the servers ro run this code and decrypt the message hidden in the picture!

They need your help. As a seasoned OpenShift AI user, you are their only hope...

Here are the two main objectives you need to achieve in this mission:

* Retrieve the message hidden in the picture.
* Set up a Jupyter Notebook environment that will allow the President to decrypt the message by himself. With a huge constraint: for security reasons, he won't have access to any keyboard. So he will only be able to use the mouse to launch a Workbench, open a Notebook, and run a cell.
